# CanvasSync
Showcase album artwork or Spotify Canvas as your device wallpaper. CanvasSync transforms your home or lock screen by dynamically displaying the currently playing track's visuals, creating a personalized and immersive listening experience.

## Compatibility
Supports all iDevices with iOS >= 15.0.

## Compiling
- The tweak does not compile out of the box because the subproject (CanvasSyncSpotify) is not included in this repository due to personal decisions. To compile it, the Makefile must be adjusted. However, the project works flawlessly without the subproject (using artwork as the background instead of live canvas).
